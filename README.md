My final project for the project defense for SoftUni. It's built on Django + JS + Bootstrap/HTML/CSS (DB - PostgreSQL).

Code Junkyard is a place for "recycling" code. Have you ever abandoned a project that contains loads of quality code? One man's trash is another man's treasure! We have to start caring about the code environment. Let's not pollute GitHub and other platforms with rusty and forgotten code. Let's start recycling and reusing code!

On the yard you can post code snippets or even whole files. It doesn't need to be great because most of the times the idea itself is more than enough. It's right about time for some treasure hunting!
